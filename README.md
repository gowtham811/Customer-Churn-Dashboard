# Customer Churn Analysis and Prediction

## Project Overview
In this project, I delved into the intricate world of customer churn analysis within a telecommunications company. The main objective was to not only analyze churn patterns but also to develop predictive models aimed at identifying at-risk customers. By leveraging Power BI, I aimed to transform raw data into actionable insights, paving the way for enhanced customer retention strategies.

## My Contribution
As part of this project, my primary task was to design and develop a comprehensive Power BI dashboard. This dashboard serves as a dynamic visualization tool, enabling stakeholders to gain deeper insights into customer churn trends and patterns. By meticulously crafting visual representations of key metrics such as churn rate, customer demographics, tenure analysis, and churn drivers, I aimed to empower decision-makers with the necessary insights to drive strategic initiatives.

## Key Features of the Power BI Dashboard
- **Churn Rate Overview**: Visualizing the churn rate to provide a clear understanding of customer attrition trends.
- **Customer Demographics**: Analyzing customer demographics including gender, partner status, and dependent status to identify potential churn patterns.
- **Customer Tenure Analysis**: Examining the distribution of customer tenure to uncover insights into long-term customer retention.
- **Churn Analysis**: Exploring churn drivers such as contract type, payment method, and internet service to understand the underlying factors contributing to churn.
